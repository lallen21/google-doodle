# My Topic Google Doodle

I made an outer space Google Doodle because I’ve always liked the space aesthetic. There’s just something about stars, planets, and the whole vibe of space that looks cool. I also really like the color purple, so it just made sense to mix the two. It was a fun way to mess around with design while making something that fits my style.
